•	Generate SSH Key Pair (on client machine)

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@domain.com"

- Accept default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) or specify custom path
- Set a passphrase for additional security (recommended) : test123

•	Copy Public Key to Server
Method 1: Using ssh-copy-id (easiest)
ssh-copy-id username@server_ip

•	Set Up Authorized Keys on Server
bash# On the server, create .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.ssh

Add public key to authorized_keys
cat ~/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Set proper permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Remove the uploaded public key file
rm ~/id_rsa.pub


•	Test SSH Key Authentication
Test from client machine
ssh username@server_ip
